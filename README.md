# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

set work directory (where the unzip file was dowloaded)
Load all data sets into R
merge data sets 
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average (mean) of each variable for each activity and each subject
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
